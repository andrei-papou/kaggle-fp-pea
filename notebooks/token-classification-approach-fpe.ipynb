I thought of a different way that only needs one forward pass *per essay*. Thus the number of forward passes, without considering batching, drops from 36k to 4k. \n\nIn essence, I treat it as a token classification problem instead of text classification. I insert in CLS tokens before each discourse text within the essay text and then I use the output from the classification head only at those CLS tokens to calculate class scores. \n\nTo prepare the input, I add CLS tokens to the essay at the beginning of each discourse text. I also decided to add END tokens so that the model understands where the discourse text ends. I decided to make one CLS/END token for each discourse type.\n\n### Example essay text\n> Driverless cars are exaclty what you would expect them to be.

[END_CONCLUDING STATEMENT]\\</s\\>\n\n\nThe next step involves putting -100 labels for each token except for the CLS tokens so the loss is calculated only for CLS tokens. This is all illustrated in the image below:\n\n![token classification diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nbroad1881/kaggle-images/main/feedback-prize-effectiveness/token-classification-diagram.png)\n\n\n# Notes\n- Adding CLS and END tokens means a search must be done to find the start and end indexes of the discourse_text in the essay.  Searching for the discourse_text sometimes results in no matches. I noticed this mainly happens due to different whitespace at the end. When stripping the whitespace from discourse_text and searching, there is only one instance of the discourse_text not being in the essay. In this case, the discourse_text contains different words compared to the associated essay, as noticed in [this post here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-effectiveness/discussion/331544).\n    - Sometimes the discourse_text is in multiple locations in the essay. To deal with this, I assume that the order of rows in train.csv is from the beginning of the essay to the end. If I search one at a time, starting at the beginning, I’ll take the first occurrence of the span. I can keep track of the end index of the last discourse_text that I searched for, so the next span must start after the previous one. \n    - I added a check that confirms that only 1 discourse_text was not matched correctly.\n- The CV does not use grouped or stratified splits. \n- I used longformer base in my notebook and it takes about 10 minutes per epoch using 80% of the data for training.\n\nI don’t know if this can beat the standard approach, but maybe it will be good enough and fast enough to be competitive for the efficiency prize. Or maybe it will just add some diversity to your ensemble.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Config","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cfg = {\n    \"num_proc\": 2,\n    #
